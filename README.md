# deeplearning-tryout
try out deep learning with chainer for myself, whether CNN can identify twins. 

I referenced several online resource that are shared on the Internet to completed, and appreciate the all.
The result is model was over-fitted since it seems that I did not have enough data. I need to upgrade them after now on.
